This app was made to do something that I wanted automated, but is just as much for the practice. 

Things to do:
-Clean up style

-Hook up with db for persistence 
-- User accounts
-- Week/month reports

-Some sort of menu bar for navigating

-Ability to choose whether an acivity is productive or not... but keep a default too somehow? 

-Page to see all the days activities (another page?)
-- Ability to adjust activites in that ^ view 

-Add icons
